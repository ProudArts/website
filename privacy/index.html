  <h1>Privacy Policy — Proud Arts</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 2025-MM-DD</em></p>

  <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p>Proud Arts (“we”, “us”) develops and publishes video games, including <strong>MotoTrials</strong>.</p>

  <h2>What we access when you sign in</h2>
  <p>When you sign in with a platform account (for example, <strong>Epic Games</strong>, Steam, PlayStation™ Network, Xbox Live, or Nintendo), we may receive limited basic profile information from that platform and read your <strong>entitlements</strong> to verify you own the game or related content.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basic profile</strong>: display name and preferred language/locale.</li>
    <li><strong>Entitlements/ownership</strong>: whether your account owns the game/DLC.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For features like achievements/trophies and in-game overlays provided by a platform (e.g., Epic’s Social Overlay and Achievements), we use the platform’s official services to display and update your progress.</p>

  <h2>What we do <em>not</em> receive</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your platform password or full account credentials.</li>
    <li>Payment card numbers processed by platform stores.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What we store</h2>
  <p>We store only what’s needed to operate the game and your progress, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Local save data and settings on your device.</li>
    <li>Achievement/trophy unlock state (where applicable).</li>
    <li>Crash reports or analytics <em>only if you opt in</em> or your platform provides them under its own policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use your information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate you with the platform so you can play your licensed content.</li>
    <li>Show and update achievements/trophies and related UI.</li>
    <li>Support gameplay features you choose to use (e.g., cloud saves where supported by the platform).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-party platforms</h2>
  <p>Your platform provider (e.g., Epic Games, Valve, Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) processes your account data under its own terms and privacy policy. Please review their policies for details on how they handle your information.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>Our games are intended for general audiences. If a title is directed to children or uses an age-rating that requires parental controls, we follow the platform’s parental consent mechanisms.</p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can change your display name, privacy, or data settings with your platform provider.</li>
    <li>You can request we delete crash/diagnostics we control—contact us below.</li>
  </ul>
